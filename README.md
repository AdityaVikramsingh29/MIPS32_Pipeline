# MIPS32_Pipeline
This repo is a implementation of pipelining in MIPS32 processor. It begins with instruction fetch, followed by decoding, execution, memory access, and write back. This architecture enhances performance by concurrently processing multiple instructions, reducing cycle time, and simplifying control logic while ensuring data integrity.
